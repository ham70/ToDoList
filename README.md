# ToDoList
This repository contains the code for a todo list desktop app I built taking heavy inspiration from Sean Tracey's YouTube video which is linked in the README.

The pack and res folders contain all the source code I used to complete this project.
The .exe file is the jar file anyone may use to run their app on their computer. A JDK and minimum JRe of version 1.4.0 is required to run this application. 
The .xml file was created by the standard when wrapping the jar file using launch4j to give the application a costume icon.
